# Build Your Own Framework

Now that you have already used a framework of your choice, you must now implement some features on a framework of your own.  
That's right ‚Äî you are going to **create a framework**.

---

## ‚ö° Framework vs Library

Be aware that a **framework** is different from a **library**:

- With a **library**, **you** are in control (you call its methods).  
- With a **framework**, the control is inverted: **the framework calls you**.

---

## üéØ Objectives

Your framework should implement:

- ‚úÖ Abstracting the DOM  
- ‚úÖ Routing System  
- ‚úÖ State Management  
- ‚úÖ Event Handling  

You will also need to make a **TodoMVC project** using your framework.

---

## üìò Instructions

1. You must create **documentation** for your framework, so that users (auditors) are able to understand and know how to use it without confusion.  
2. Your framework will be tested by using it, just like you previously used one in the social network project.  
3. Provide a **folder structure** that allows the tester to run the app from the root.  
4. The tester should be able to implement **simple code** to test the required features.  
5. You are **not allowed to use** existing frameworks/libraries like React, Angular, Vue, etc.

---

## üìù Documentation

Your documentation should explain:

- How the framework works  
- How to use it in practice  

A new user must be able to:  

- Create an element  
- Create an event  
- Nest elements  
- Add attributes to an element  

And also understand **why things work the way they work**.

## üß© Features to Implement

### 1. Abstracting the DOM

You will have to implement a way to handle the DOM.  
The DOM can be seen as a big object. Example:

```html
<html>
  <div class="nameSubm">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Insert Name" />
    <input type="submit" placeholder="Submit" />
  </div>
</html>
```

```json
{
  "tag": "html",
  "attrs": {},
  "children": [
    {
      "tag": "div",
      "attrs": {
        "class": "nameSubm"
      },
      "children": [
        {
          "tag": "input",
          "attrs": {
            "type": "text",
            "placeholder": "Insert Name"
          }
        },
        {
          "tag": "input",
          "attrs": {
            "type": "submit",
            "placeholder": "Submit"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

With this approach, you can manipulate the DOM more easily in JS.

Possible techniques:

Virtual DOM ‚Üí compare desired changes with real DOM, update only what‚Äôs needed

Data Binding ‚Üí keep data sources synchronized

Templating ‚Üí client-side data binding with JS

Your DOM must handle events, children, and attributes of each element.

2. Routing System

Routing synchronizes the state of the app with the URL.
You must provide a simple way to:

Change the URL through user actions

Update the state accordingly

3. State Management

The state of an app = the outcome of all actions since page load.
Example: if a user clicks a button ‚Üí state changes.

Requirements:

Implement a way to handle state

Allow multiple pages to access and update the same state

4. Event Handling

Implement a custom way to handle user events (scroll, click, keybindings, etc.).
‚ö†Ô∏è This must be different from addEventListener().

‚úÖ TodoMVC Project

You must create a TodoMVC project with your framework.

Requirements:

Replicate all elements of the official TodoMVC examples (IDs, classes, etc.)

Fully functional (add, remove, edit todos, filter list, etc.)

Use your framework to render and manage state
